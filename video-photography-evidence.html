              <h2 class="section-heading">Photography Basics</h2>
              <p>The production of a photo comprises of three important structures: the ISO, the Aperture and the Shutter Speed. The aperture controls how much light enters the camera. The aperture settings are known as ‘f stops’. The lower the f stop, the more light the camera lets in – this is useful for when the photographer is in low light conditions. Likewise, the higher the f stop, the less light the camera lets in. The aperture also controls how much of the photograph is in focus (the depth of field). The shutter speed is also an important aspect in photography. The shutter speed is the length of time the shutter is open or how long the camera takes to capture the photo. This can be used to determine whether the subject of the photo is clear or blurred. Lowering the shutter speed makes the subject blurrier whilst raising the shutter speed makes it clearer (i.e. produces a still image). The ISO is another important pillar of photography as it determines how bright the photograph will be, the lower the ISO, the darker the photograph. When taking the photographs, I used a dslr, meaning I had more control over the settings used capture images.

              <h2 class="section-heading">Video Production Basics</h2>

              <p>Composition is an important thing when recording a video. Making sure that a certain subject is in focus or even the background is in focus. In the videos we made sure the presenter was in the centre of the frame when he was talking alone. If he was next to a subject of interest, the presenter would be next to the subject while it was in the centre. We used a standard filming camera to shoot our takes. In terms of lighting, most of the video was filmed with natural lighting and with the lights provided by the building we were in. In the edited video, I added a backing music and made sure that the video started off with a transition. We had to recolour the shots inside the shop and during the interview since the footage appeared a little orange. We used a tripod for all the shots in the video. </p>
